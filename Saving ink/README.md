# Saving Ink

### Explan

+ Susan likes to make a line drawing with ink. Thereâ€˜re several dots on drawing paper.
+ Your job is to tell Susan how to connect the dots so as to minimize the amount of ink used.
+ If all the dots are connected, Susan will not draw anymore. In other words, the drawn figure does not need to be closed.
